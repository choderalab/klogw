title: Introduction

This is a blog about algorithms for molecular simulation, sampling methods, simulating systems with true chemical fidelity, statistical mechanics, cargo cult science in drug discovery, and Markov chain Monte Carlo in general.

### Blogging platform

This site uses the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator.
It was based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), and designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site.
It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.
Equation support is provided via [MathJax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/).

### MathJax

This is some math:
$$ \mathbf{X}_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}_{n,k} \mathbf{B}_{k,p} $$
