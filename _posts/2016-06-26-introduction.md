This is a blog about algorithms for molecular simulation, sampling methods, simulating systems with true chemical fidelity, statistical mechanics, cargo cult science in drug discovery, effective science communication, reproducible science, and Markov chain Monte Carlo in general.

Various members of [the Chodera lab](http://choderalab.org) will contribute from time to time as we have interesting results to share, useful literature roundups, or new ideas for algorithms.

As always, we appreciate your feedback! You can find us at [http://choderalab.org](http://choderalab.org) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jchodera).

### Blogging platform

This site uses the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator.
It was based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), and designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site.
It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.
Equation support is provided via [MathJax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/), like this:

$$ \mathbf{X}_{n,p} = \mathbf{A}_{n,k} \mathbf{B}_{k,p} $$
