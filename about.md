This is a blog about algorithms for molecular simulation, sampling methods, simulating systems with true chemical fidelity, statistical mechanics, cargo cult science in drug discovery, and Markov chain Monte Carlo in general.

The Chodera lab uses computation and experiment to develop quantitative, multiscale models of the effects of small molecules on biomolecular macromolecules and cellular pathways. To do this, the group utilizes physical models and rigorous statistical mechanics, with overall goals of engineering novel therapeutics and tools for chemical biology, as well as understanding the physical driving forces behind the evolution of resistance mutations. The group makes use of advanced algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs and distributed computing platforms, in addition to robot-driven high-throughput experiments focusing on characterizing biophysical interactions between proteins and small molecules.
