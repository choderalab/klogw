### Blogging platform

This site uses the excellent [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator.
It was based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), and designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site.
It does so by furnishing a full vanilla Jekyll install with example layouts, pages, posts, and styles.

Equation support is provided via [MathJax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/extras/).
